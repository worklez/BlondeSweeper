## BlondeSweeper
Yet another minesweeper clone.

This project was a task at the university Java course (2nd year, 4th semester).

Pushed to GitHub for fun and history.

## Known issues :)
Top records do not work when running from a jar.

UI looks weird on Mac OS X so run on GNU/Linux or Window for
the best experience.
